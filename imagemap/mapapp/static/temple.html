            Sri Santhana Srinivasa Perumal Temple is a Hindu temple located in Mugappair West near Anna Nagar in Chennai.
            The place was originally known as "Maga-pperu" in Tamil which means "Blessed with a child".
            Later the name Magapperu got colloquially transformed to Mogappair.Around 650 years ago, Sri Arunachalam Mudaliar was informed about the existence of the Idol/Vigraham of Santana Srinivasa Perumal by Lord Vishnu himself in his dream in Mugappair.
            Sri Arunachalam Mudaliar started the construction of the temple and today it is a spacious temple near the heart of the city.
            There is a seven tier Raja Gopuram as we enter the temple, Santana Srinivasa Sannidhi, Santana Lakshmi Sannidhi and Andal Sannidhi.
            There is also sannidhi for Ganapathy and Anjaneya.
